      "message": "I feel like calling notifyDataSetChanged() here will do some unnecessary work, as all views reflecting the data will update every time (super class behavior). The only thing that really changes at each progress update is that the icon for a specific package name has updated. Can you add a method that will update that particular icon at every progress update, possibly?",
