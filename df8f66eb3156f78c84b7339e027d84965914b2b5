      "message": "Raj, IHMO is better to hidethe icon, because that is the initial behaviour when you enter the first time in this screen and have no pattern. And the most important, why do you want to allow to reset the pattern if you don\u0027t have a pattern to reset yet?",

      "message": "Agreed, sorry my comment is misplaced. I didn\u0027t mean to replace the \"invalidateOptionsMenu\" just that it would make sense to also add the call to clear the pattern, this way, when the user is presented with another opportunity to set their pattern, they don\u0027t have the failed pattern still in view.",
