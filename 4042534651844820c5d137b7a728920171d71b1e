I haven\u0027t run this patch yet, but what happens when the user goes to the recover their pattern and tries to enter a primary account in the recover screen? Will the EditText getting focus allow the soft keyboard to come up?",

It is true that we don\u0027t need it.\n\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams.html#SOFT_INPUT_STATE_ALWAYS_HIDDEN\n\n\"Please always hide any soft input area when this window receives focus.\" The bad behavior this is presenting is that when the window receives focus, the soft input is shown. So we\u0027re asking that WindowManager please not show it. The soft input behaves normally after the Activity is loaded.",
