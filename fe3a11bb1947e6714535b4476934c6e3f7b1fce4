      "message": "I asked myself this several times, but I don\u0027t think I can. FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON is a WindowManager flag that is only used to keep the screen on after the activity has been launched. PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK is the only non deprecated wake_lock flag that I can use here, but it is not compatible with ACQUIRE_CAUSES_WAKEUP, which is what I need to happen, since the device can go right to sleep after the daydream is woken from.\n\nI can try to see if just having FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON in the dialog is enough to turn the screen on when it\u0027s created. If so, that will probably make most of this patch useless, but I\u0027ll see.",
