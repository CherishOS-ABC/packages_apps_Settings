      "message": "From someone in our telegram chat:\n\u003e Hello guys! Since the lineage 20 update connecting to a WPA2-Enterprise network has been a bit annoying. The \"do not validate\" option in CA certificate spinner was removed and I have to use the \"trust on first use\" option instead, but the saved certificate doesn\u0027t work when I try to connect for the second time. Is it possible to bring back the \"do not validate\" option with the fix in previous versions?",
