      "message": "I think a frameworks/base translation patch to make this consistent is more suitable there. E.g. for German, most of them start lower case (with the notable exception of the in_num_hours plural, where the singular form starts lower case, but the plural form starts upper case *facepalm*), so one could argue that it should be like that for all languages. Alternatively, the spam_added_title (and spam_last_blocked_title) string could be adjusted to say something among the lines of \"%s added\".\n\ntoLowerCase() is not suitable in any case as it destroys _all_ capitalization: in German, the string would become e.g. \u0027vor 5 minuten\u0027, which is definitely wrong.",
