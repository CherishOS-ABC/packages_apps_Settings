      "message": "That\u0027s the whole point. Any package can claim to be whisperpush2 if it gets there first. This verifies that at least this package has jumped through enough hoops that it is getting restricted permissions.\n\nOtherwise somebody could potentially fake the WP registration activity, and do who knows what. So if the package is present, but doesn\u0027t have the perms, we ignore it and keep using the built in WP (for better or worse).",
