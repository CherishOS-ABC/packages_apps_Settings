It may be due to the default file that is encode based on the Windows-1258 (or something else) encoding, so when I open with Notepad++, it has replaced that white space character with the same white space character as the UTF-8.\nBut that alternative doesn\u0027t affect compilation as well as showing because it\u0027s the same, that alternative sometimes helps avoid errors displayed on some UVN fonts of Vietnamese.\nI have updated the file again (and also overcome a few more errors), please review it!",
