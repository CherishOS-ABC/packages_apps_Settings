      "message": "The patch is now a work-in-progress, and I would like to write down my ideas here:\n1. I think there is still a need to add a new xml value to show the available resolutions, and here is my reasons: Different devices might have different number of resolutions, and for each resolution, the current implementation uses \"config_screen_resolution_options_strings\" and \"config_screen_resolution_summaries_strings\" to display the information about the resolution. Those 2 configs and the resolution is highly coupled, meaning that one entry in the options string corresponds to one summary string, and corresponds to one specific resolution. So adding a xml value for available resolutions will force the ordering of the resolution array.\n2. Don\u0027t know if updateIllustrationImage is really needed, because we have no images for different resolutions...",
